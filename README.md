# DLOmix Resources

This repo contains example datasets and Jupyter notebooks for [DLOmix](https://github.com/wilhelm-lab/dlomix), a deep learning library for Proteomics. 

Experiment a simple retention time prediction use-case:
- using Google Colab &nbsp;&nbsp; [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wilhelm-lab/dlomix-resources/blob/main/notebooks/Example_RTModel_Walkthrough_colab.ipynb)

**Folder Structure:**
- `example_dataset`: Toy dataset for experimenting with Retention Time prediction, includes different splits for experimentation and performance evaluation
- `notebooks`: example Jupyter notebooks with walkthroughs and tasks using [DLOmix](https://github.com/wilhelm-lab/dlomix).
- `notebooks/tasks`: notebooks explaining a simple task to do using the framework and based on the [Retention Time Prediction notebook example](https://github.com/wilhelm-lab/dlomix-resources/blob/main/notebooks/Example_RTModel_Walkthrough_colab.ipynb)
